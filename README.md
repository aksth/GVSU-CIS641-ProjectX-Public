# ProjectX

*Just a public GitHub Pages Website of the term project [(GVSU-CIS641-ProjectX)](https://github.com/aksth/GVSU-CIS641-ProjectX). ProjectX is the code name for my project that I'm doing as a part of my course [CIS 641 at GVSU](https://www.gvsu.edu/catalog/course/cis-641.htm).* 

## Overview

ProjectX is a classified advertisement posting website. The application would feature a simple and elegant user interface to manage the classifieds. It would also feature a smart search that would serve them with precise and relevant information they're looking for based on the full-text search approach to be used.

Technically, this project shall be implemented using Java Spring Framework in the backend and Angular for the frontend. To maintain the contract for these, we would be following API-first approach, preferably with OpenAPI tools. We shall also use IAM/IDP for user management and access controls. For the search feature, we may implement ElasticSearch for real-time full-text search and search analytics. The project shall be implemented using all modern principles of software development from TDD to CI/CD.
